        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It's a sandwich, but mexican</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 c. panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 c. unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 (1/4"-thick) chicken cutlets (about 1 lb. total)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>4 telera, bolillo, or other soft, 5" rolls</li>
            <li>1 (16-oz.) can refried pinto or black beans, warmed</li>
            <li>1/4 white onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 oz. queso fresco, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 ripe small tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 large avocado, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 c. fresh cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 c. mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 c. sliced pickled jalapeños</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, crush panko a few times with your hands to break into smaller pieces. In another shallow bowl, beat eggs to combine. Place flour in a third shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. black pepper. Working one at a time, coat chicken in flour, shaking off excess. Dip chicken into egg, then into panko, pressing to adhere. Transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>Into a large heavy pot, pour oil to a depth of 1/4"; heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry 2 cutlets, turning halfway through, until chicken is cooked through and panko is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet or paper-towel lined plate; season with salt. Repeat with remaining cutlets.</li>
            <li>Slice rolls open. Spread cut side of bottom buns with beans. Sprinkle with onion and cheese, then top with cutlets, tomato, avocado, and cilantro. Spread cut side of top bun with mayonnaise and top with jalapeños. Close sandwiches and serve.</li>
        </ol>
